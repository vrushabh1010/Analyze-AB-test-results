# Analyze AB test results
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

Understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

## Project Overview
A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

#### What do we need to install?
We will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Statsmodels
* Scipy
* Csv

It is recommended to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. 

## Statistical Analysis Scope
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions
- P-value and Z-score calculation
- Logistic regression

## Results
There was no sufficient evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.
